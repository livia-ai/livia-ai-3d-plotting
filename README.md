Python Script to create 3D plots with Plotly: main.py

-> sentence_embeddings_wien_museum.csv is on Google Drive in folder 04_Data

## Some minor enhancements/questions

- [ ] We don't really need the text pre-processing step for the vis, if I understand correctly
- [ ] Can we sample N records? (Right now, we're picking the first N)
- [ ] Can we add the record ID to the sentence embeddings file? (So we can use it as a standalone dataset)
- [ ] It looks like the sentence embeddings correlate better with the classficiations rather than the subjects. I wonder why that's the case?
